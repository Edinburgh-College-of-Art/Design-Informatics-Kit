## Code Examples

Example project code

### Bluetooth Spy

Get the Arduino to look for all the bluetooth devices in range. Light up a certain colour if particular devices are there

### Unity Controller

Get unity responding to data coming in from the Arduino to move 3d objects around

### Remote Send / Receive

Get Arduinos talking with MQTT to send data (e.g. from a knob or or temp sensor) and receive it (e.g. set servo position, flash LEDs)

### Sensor Logger

Send the output of a sensor to a cloud service for later analysis

### Talk to Phone

Send some data to a phone app, or respond to it in some way â€“ pretend to be a smart light?

### Chat Server

Take text over the serial input, display it on the screen and send it out over MQTT. Display incoming text on the display in a different colour

### Capacitive Sensing

(although we might need some 1M resistors...)
Use the copper tape to make a 3D controller, connect to something interesting

### IFTTT

Connect the Arduino to an IFTTT recipe
