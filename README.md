## Setup

See the [Getting Started guide](./getting-started.md) for instructions on setting up to use your kit.

## Additional notes

Notes on usage and helpful techniques

## Code Examples

Example project code

### Sensors

#### Capacitive Sensing

(although we might need some 1M resistors...)
Use the copper tape to make a 3D controller, connect to something interesting

### BLE

#### Bluetooth Spy

Get the Arduino to look for all the bluetooth devices in range. Light up a certain colour if particular devices are there

#### Unity Controller

Get unity responding to data coming in from the Arduino to move 3d objects around

  - [Ardity](https://ardity.dwilches.com)

#### Talk to Phone

Send some data to a phone app, or respond to it in some way â€“ pretend to be a smart light.

- LightBlue: [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lightblue/id557428110) / [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.punchthrough.lightblueexplorer&hl=en_US)

### MQTT

#### Remote Send / Receive

Get Arduino talking with MQTT to send data (e.g. from a knob or or temp sensor) and receive it (e.g. set servo position, flash LEDs)

#### Sensor Logger

Send the output of a sensor to a cloud service for later analysis

Services:

- Adafruit IO
- ThingSpeak

#### Chat Server

Take text over the serial input, display it on the screen and send it out over MQTT. Display incoming text on the display in a different colour

### APIs

#### List of APIs

[See the Public list APIs](https://public-apis.io) for some inspiration

### IFTTT

Connect the Arduino to an IFTTT recipe

### ThingSpeak

## Extras

Some extra tidbits to make life easier

### Nano Pinout

Pins on the nano are labelled in such small typeface it can be difficult to read. [This .pdf](./extras/Nano_33_IoT_Pinout_cheatsheet.pdf) can be printed out, placed over your breadboard and the Arduino can plugged in on top. Get creative and try making your own.
