# Getting Started

This document will cover how to install the necessary software and libraries to getting started with your Arduino kit.

## Arduino IDE

### Arduino Libraries

### Firmware Updates

Make sure your wifi module is the latest firmware. If you've downloaded Arduino IDE before, check your WifiNINA library and make sure it is at version `1.6.0`.

The firmware of your wifi would be `1.3.0`. Everyone should be starting at firmware `1.2.3` so you **will** need to update.
